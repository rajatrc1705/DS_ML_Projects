# Youtube Video Classification [WIP]

## Dataset ðŸ’¾

I could have used a ready made API, but just for the fun of it, I scraped the data from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) using <b>Selenium</b>. The total number of videos scraped was <b>3600</b>. 
I scraped the following things from each video:
 - Link
 - Title
 - Description
<br>
I queried the videos for 4 categories:<br><br>

 - Travel Vlogs
 - Food
 - Art and Music
 - History
