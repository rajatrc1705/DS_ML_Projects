# Insurance Prediction Project

## Motivation

I wanted to get started with some basic algorithms that are used in Data Science and Machine Learning. I thought that a regression project is the most basic way in which I can kickstart my journey of learning Data Science.

## Dataset 

Although I have a profound interest in collecting my own data, I came across this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance).
The dataset has various attributes such as age, number of children and such. The primary motive of this dataset is to be able to predict the amount of insurance moneyðŸ’² used by the person.
